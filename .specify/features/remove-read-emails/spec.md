# Feature Specification: Remove Read Emails from Inbox

**Feature Branch**: `feature/remove-read-emails`  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to add a new feature, that remove read email from inbox. The current workflow will only subtract information from unread email with given label, and mark email as read. However, I also need to remove these email from gmail inbox."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-23
- Q: What is the desired behavior when the script encounters an error *before* it gets to the stage of removing the email from the inbox? → A: Stop processing immediately, leave the email as-is(unread and in the inbox) and log the error.
- Q: Should the script archive previously read emails with the target label that might still be in the inbox from a past run? → A: No, only archive emails that are processed from unread to read in the current run.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Archive Processed Emails (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want the application to automatically remove emails from my inbox after they have been processed, so that my inbox remains clean and only contains actionable items.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the feature request and directly addresses the user's pain point of a cluttered inbox.

**Independent Test**: This can be tested by running the script within github action on a labeled, unread email in the inbox. The test is successful if the email is processed, marked as read, and no longer visible in the primary inbox view.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an unread email with the target label is in the inbox, **When** the script processes the email, **Then** the email is marked as read and removed from the inbox.
2. **Given** a read email with the target label is in the inbox, **When** the script runs, **Then** the email is not processed again but is removed from the inbox.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an email with the target label is in the trash? The system should ignore it.
- How does the system handle a failure to remove the email from the inbox after processing? The system should log the error and continue, leaving the email in the inbox to be handled manually.
- How does the system handle any other processing error (e.g., API connection failure)? The system should stop processing immediately, leaving the affected email unread and in the inbox.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST identify emails that have not been processed based on their "unread" status.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST remove any email that it marks as "read" during the current execution from the user's inbox.
- **FR-003**: The action of removing an email from the inbox SHOULD be equivalent to Gmail's "Archive" functionality (removing the 'inbox' label).
- **FR-004**: The system MUST NOT delete the email permanently.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST log any errors that occur during the process of removing an email from the inbox.

### Assumptions

- The script has already been granted the necessary permissions (e.g., via OAuth 2.0) to read and modify the user's emails.
- The sole indicator that an email has been "processed" is its status being changed from "unread" to "read".
- The process of removing the email from the inbox is intended to be non-destructive (archiving, not permanent deletion).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of emails processed by the script are removed from the inbox view.
- **SC-002**: No other emails without the user given label will be affected or proccess
- **SC-003**: The number of emails visible in the inbox with the target label decreases to zero after the script has run successfully.
